# my_website_collaboration

The project is building a personal website for Eugene Nesterenko, as a part of Data Science for Business course in London Business School.

The purpose of the website is shraing personal information about me (bio, CV, contact info), as well as demonstrate the data analysis skills acquired in the course.

Netlify had initially named the website "subtle-bombolone-0cfe1d", I have changed it to "eugene-nesterenko-lbs"
